You may have problems with security software (Nuts and bolts ect..), if so just disable it and all should be well.

This is where the gui for your replacement windows shell would go. If you can see the desktop icons (my computer, recycle bin ect...) 
you need to click here to open c:\windows\system.ini and change the line 
shell=explorere.exe(or litestep.exe) to where the executable for this application 
is(see the text box below). Then restart you computer. And magicaly you will see this 
again. To return your system to normal again open c:\windows\system.ini  again and change 
the shell = line to look like this shell = explorer.exe. Hopefully this will cause some 
of you to make your own shells and the shell scene will rocket. Maybe just maybe. E-mail 
your replacement shells to me. Chris
